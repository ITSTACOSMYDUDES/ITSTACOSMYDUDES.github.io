					Competitive
				</h1>
				<p>
					Competitive rounds is a more difficult version of the game created by the comunity as a way for more skilled players to find other players of similar skill levels.
					The skill of a player is graded by an ELO ranking system with higher ELO meaning you are a better player.
					Every player starts with 1000 ELO which can be increased by defeating an opponent, however, if you were to lose a game, this would cause your ELO to decrease.
					The ammount of ELO gained or lost by defeating or losing to an opponent is determined by there ELO.
					If you defeat a higher ELO opponent then your ELO will increase more upon winning and less upon losing.
					However, if you lose to a lower ELO opponent then your ELO will decrease more then normal and will increase less upon winning.
					This is all calculated inside of the Rounds Competitive Discord server.
					The video below is a full competitive game.
