					Mods
				</h1>
				<p>
					Rounds has a massive modding comunity with the general experience of the game being greatly enhanced through the use of these mods.
					Mods are installed by changing your game version to old rounds for mods in the Properties, then Betas section of steam.
					All modding is done through a program called thunderstore mod manager which makes modding easy and streamlined
					Unfoutuanatly modding is not possible on console.
					There are many mods that change many different aspects of the game such as mods that add more cards, mods that add new abilities, mods that add new maps and even a mod that adds multiplayer for up to 16 players and many more.
					There are even mods that allow the game to last forever and never end, however this can lead to a very chaotic and laggy game.
					The video bellow shows some clips from a normal modded game and how chaotic it can end up getting.

					Lopi's Parkour
				</h1>
				<p>
					Lopi's Parkour is one of very few singleplayer mods for Rounds.
					This mod created by the user, Lopidav is less about shooting opponents and winning like normal Rounds, but instead focuses on the more niche mechanic of solo platforming.
					In this mod the goal is to get from the start to the finish as fast as possible.
					There are currently 20 main maps which range in difficulty starting quite simple, and finishing with every difficult new mechanic you have learned throughout the mod.
					There are also 2 expansions currently out for the mod adding even more maps with even more expansions on the way.
					The video below is a full completion of the final level in the main mod.
