					Gameplay
				</h1>
				<p>
					The gameplay mechanics in rounds are simple.
					At the start of every game there are 2 oposing sides, orange and blue.
					Upon the game starting each side is prompted to choose 1 of 5 cards that appear on there screen, each or varying rarity being common (<font color="white">clear</font>), uncommon (<font color="aqua">blue</font>) and rare (<font color="fuchsia">purple</font>).
					These cards give you varying abilities and buffs to your gun and block which may allow you to gain the upper hand in combat.
					The combat in rounds is simple, the player has a gun that is fired when left click is pressed, and a block that is used when right click is pressed.
					The block allows you to parry a bullet back in the same direction it came from if timed right and can also activate abilities if the right cards are picked.
					The player needs to win 2 games to have won a full round.
					The player that loses the round will be propted to choose another 1 of 5 cards.
					This goes on until a player wins 5 rounds and wins the entire game.
